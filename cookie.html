                                        <p class="mb-3">AdSense uses cookies to improve advertising. We target advertising based on what is relevant to our website user, and to avoid showing ads that our website user has seen before.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-3">We use Google Ad Manager to block other parties from showing ads based on user interest categories or remarketing. The interest categories we can block are data collection, interest-based category cookies, match
                                            coding, subsequent data, and remarketing list cookies.</p>

                                            the user was interested in, to show the users targeted ads, even after visiting our site.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-3">We use Google campaign manager to improve reporting on campaign performance. When a user acts seeing an ad on our website, a conversion is recorded by a tag. For example, we may track when a user buys an item from
                                            our website or visits our webpage to request more information through our online form. We can also use it to track conversion for clients who click on an ad from our website and buy from the store or over the

                                        <p class="mb-3">We use Search Ads 360 to manage search engine campaigns. We can access multiple ad accounts and campaigns in Google Ads. Without it, we would have to manage ads and keywords on each search engine and platform which
                                            would make it difficult to analyze performance among different channels. </p>
