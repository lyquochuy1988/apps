The app shows you 27 Rolodex card categories, from A to Z. Depending on the first letter of your info, it is filed into these cards. The app gives you the convenience of the good old alphabetized phone book, with the modern convenience of being able to hold any number of data entries, along with powerful search functionality.</p>

                           <p class="paragraph">Every time you close and exit the app, the data is encypted securely. And it stays that way until you open the app again and enter your password. But a word of caution: there is no password recovery feature, so if you forget your password, you can say bye bye to the data stored in LockDiary. We have zero access to your phone, and we want to keep it that way. We cannot and will not assist with password recovery. So, make it a password that you can remember without having to write it down.</p>
